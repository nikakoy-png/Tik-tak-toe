<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, everybody!</h1>

<h2 align="justify">
    I would like to show and tell about my project of the game "Tic-tac-toe". The project is written based on Django and Angular, so if you are having trouble working with sockets on - maybe this repository can help you.
    </h2>
</div>

## About the project

<h4 align="justify">
As I said, I wrote the project on Django and Angular frameworks. Additional libraries are also used to create asynchronous functions or to work with sockets, the full list can be found here <a href="https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/blob/master/tik_tak_toe_back/requirements.txt">[requirements]</a>. The game provides 2 variants of the field 3x3 and 19x19. <p>
Also the program code is written using many programming patterns, such as Factory or SOLID principle. So nothing prevents you to fork it and change or add something :)
<p>
Next will be more about the backend of the project than about the front, I will try to describe the problems I encountered and what solutions I found. If you, like me, have just started working with Django-based sockets - I hope I can help you.

## Installation

<h4>

First, make sure you have <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://redis.com/redis-for-dummies/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=redis%20documentation&utm_campaign=redis360-brand-emea-19645427181&utm_content=redis-for-dummies&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpc-oBhCGARIsAH6ote-0OQOSekqkcutBQvwZWDS8QJl-pYt0fNuSvNtvXCtTsQJ8yLkVetMaAiR9EALw_wcB">Redis-server</a> running. 
They are necessary for the application to work. 
Also, double-check the environment variables so that there are no connection problems.

</h4>


#### _Option #1_ with docker

<h4 align="justify">
The project has docker-compose, you can use it and automatically deploy the containers to your local machine. To do this you will need to clone my project to yourself:

    git clone https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/tree/master

Next, go to the directory with the <a href="https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> file (which you can also modify if necessary) and enter the command:

    docker-compose up

Also fill in the dependencies on the <a href="https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/blob/master/tik_tak_toe_back/Dockerfile.django">backend</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/blob/master/tik_tak_toe_front/Dockerfile.angular">frontend</a>.
Also for sockets to work correctly, it is necessary to create ```SSL``` keys to be able to raise microservices on ```https``` protocol. For this you can refer to the official documentation of <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/">OpenSsl</a>. Yes, you can do without it, but security is always better).<p>

If you set everything up correctly, congratulations!

</h4>


#### _Option #2_ without docker

<h4 align="justify">
We should also clone the project to ourselves:

    git clone https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/tree/master

Then it is necessary to install dependencies and migrate models to the database (by the way PostgreSQL is used):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

Next, we can also create <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/">SSL</a> keys and place them in the root of the directory

Now we're ready to launch the backend:

    uvicorn tik_tak_toe_back.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl-keyfile ./ssl/localhost.key --ssl-certfile ./ssl/localhost.crt --reload

Or without keys
    
    uvicorn tik_tak_toe_back.asgi:application --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

Now let's deal with the frontend. We need to go to the root with the frontend and set dependencies:

    npm install -g @angular/cli@13
    npm ci
    ng build --configuration=production

Now we can get the frontend up and running:

    ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --ssl --configuration=ssl

Or without keys

    ng serve --host 0.0.0.0


If you set everything up correctly, congratulations!

## Features

<h4 align="justify">

As I mentioned earlier, I ran into some problems while writing a seemingly simple application. 
As you may have already noticed, I don't use sessions to authorize users, but a <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction">JWT token</a>. 
Thanks to the token that is stored in the user's cookie identifying the user is easy and fast, this is very convenient in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/ru/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28">REST</a> architecture application.

But while writing a <a href="https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/blob/master/tik_tak_toe_back/play/consumers.py">consumer</a> for the socket, an obvious problem was found, the ``scope["user"]`` method doesn't work. 
Because of this I always got an anonymous user, no matter what. 
I fixed this problem by adding a custom class for ``Middleware``. 
It parses the user request, getting the header and the user token from there. 
Sounds like a crutch, but I haven't found a better solution :)

</h4>


```
class WebSocketTokenAuthMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
    async def __call__(self, scope, receive, send):
        User = get_user_model()

        try:
            cookies = dict(scope["headers"]).get(b"cookie", b"").decode("utf-8")
            token = None
            if cookies:
                cookie_items = cookies.split(";")
                for item in cookie_items:
                    if item.strip().startswith("token="):
                        token = item.strip().split("=")[1]
                        break

            if token:
                decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, settings.SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
                user_id = decoded_token.get("user_id")
                if user_id:
                    user = await self.get_user(user_id, User)
                    scope["user"] = user

        except jwt.exceptions.InvalidTokenError:
            pass

        return await super().__call__(scope, receive, send)

    @database_sync_to_async
    def get_user(self, user_id, User):
        try:
            return User.objects.get(id=user_id)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None
```

<div align="center"><img src="https://django.readthedocs.io/en/1.4.X/_images/middleware.png"></div>

<h4 align="justify">
    
As you can see in the diagram above (in case you don't know how middleware works) the request goes both ways through all the middleware layers, and the standard class is not suitable for us.

</h4>

```
application = ProtocolTypeRouter(
    {
        "http": get_asgi_application(),
        "websocket": AllowedHostsOriginValidator(
           WebSocketTokenAuthMiddleware( # here
                AuthMiddlewareStack(URLRouter(websocket_urlpatterns))
            )
        ),
    }
)
```

<h4 align="justify">

If everything was clear with that, now there is a problem that I think everyone who writes asynchronous <a href="https://github.com/nikakoy-png/Tik-tak-toe/blob/master/tik_tak_toe_back/play/views.py">views</a> has faced.
The thing is that so far there is no standard solution for creating such endpoints, because the standard ```djangorestframework``` library does not support asynchronous views.
The only working solution I found is to use a custom library that allows you to do this.
So, if you are facing this problem now, please take a look at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/adrf/">adrf</a>.
    
    from adrf.decorators import api_view

It's also worth remembering that you can't use the models before Django loads them ;)

Surprisingly, everything was smooth with the front and there were no peculiarities.

<h4 align="justify">

These are the main problems I encountered, there were many more, but what I have listed are more common in my opinion, thanks for your attention!
